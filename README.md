# ones.pw

ones.pw is a single page website that I created that does all the generation on the client side.  That way the server never sees the secrets, nor can the server influence the secrets.

## Getting Started

Go to [ones.pw](https://ones.pw) and grab a new password.

### Installing

Just clone this repo to any modern webserver and browse to it.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The bits that make it look pretty and responsive
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Because I like starting text editor wars.
